# Shopify-Application Asp.NET app fully interated with shopify
An ASP.NET Core application designed for seamless integration with Shopify stores, offering a range of versatile functionalities.

##  Project Overview
This project is a Shopify application built using ASP.NET Core MVC, which integrates with Shopify's API to handle and manage e-commerce functionalities. The application is designed to process API requests and responses between Shopify and our web service, using Shopify CLI for local development and deployment.

##  Features
Key features of the application include:

- Handling Shopify API requests (webhooks, product updates, orders, etc.) and responses.
- Using Shopify CLI to streamline development and authenticate the app with Shopify.
- Creating controllers in ASP.NET Core to manage API requests and process data.
- Implementing validation and authorization for secure API calls.
- Managing and manipulating data using Entity Framework Core with SQL Server.
- Publishing and hosting the app on Microsoft Azure, ensuring scalability and availability.

### 1. API Request and Response Handling
This application interacts with Shopifyâ€™s API, allowing the app to manage resources like products, orders, and customers.
- Incoming Webhooks: The app listens for specific events triggered from Shopify (e.g., when a product is updated or an order is placed).
- Outgoing API Calls: The app can make API requests to Shopify, such as retrieving or updating products.

### 2. Shopify CLI Integration
- We use the Shopify CLI to facilitate local development, manage environment variables, and handle the OAuth flow for app authentication with Shopify stores.

### 3. Controllers for API Handling
- The application includes controllers in ASP.NET Core MVC that handle both GET and POST requests from Shopify. Each action is tied to specific Shopify events or API calls, processing the incoming data and performing necessary operations.

### 4. Validation and Authorization
- To secure communication, the app includes:
- OAuth Authentication: Ensures that only authenticated Shopify stores can interact with the app.
